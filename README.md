Communication protocol for paying domestic bills

All functionality that is required by the document has been implemeneted. 
Unfortunately, the XML is not working at all again, I am not sure why, it was working at some point and at some point while I was working on the project, it stopped working again.
The json, however is working for both sending requests and receiving responses, but if you use @JsonProperty to change the name of the propery it disappears from the response.
Everything has been tested on json and the implemented features are working as intended. Overall the project might need some slight adjustments.
